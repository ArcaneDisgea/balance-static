## Major Mechanics

The Cloud of Darkness is an 9:59 encounter and has a DPS check of roughly 98k including adds.

#### Pre-pull Preparation

Assign all players clock spots with ranged on cardinals and melee on intercardinals. Assign each DPS a tank/healer partner, preferably by rotating CW or CCW from their clock spot. Split these two groups into a left group and right group. All players should have a cardinal spot, either in or out, for tiles, and each player should have a tower spot.

#### Mechanic Overview

**The Art of Darkness**\
The Cloud of Darkness will summon orbs around her body. The type of orb determines what kind of mechanic she casts at the end of the castbar.\
**One orb**\
If there is one orb on the left or the right side, the Cloud of Darkness will cleave the side of the arena the orb is on.\
**Two orbs**\
If there are two orbs, the Cloud of Darkness will target all four DPS with a stack marker that inflicts magic vulnerability. This must be shared with a tank or healer.\
**Giant orb**\
If there is a giant orb in the middle, the Cloud of Darkness wil cast a conal AoE at every player, which must be spread.

In addition, the Cloud of Darkness will often change the layout of the arena. This is accompanied by heavy raidwide magical damage. The arena begins in the normal “darkness” layout.

**Obscure Wood**\
Changes the arena to the wood layout. This will summon four trees at cardinal positions outside the arena.

**Empty Plane**\
Changes the arena to the panel layout. On the panel layout, players cannot:

* Stand on the same panel as another player – they will fall through the panel and die.
* Stand on the same panel for longer than ~15 seconds.

**Deluge of Darkness**\
Changes the arena to the normal layout. Additionally removes the Cloying Condensation debuff.

#### General Fight Mechanics

**Ground-razing Particle Beam**\
A moderate raidwide AoE that deals magic damage.

**Devouring Dark**\
A two-hit tank buster. The first hit inflicts a magic vulnerability on the current MT and deals light damage, then a heavy magical line AoE is shot at the current MT. The OT must provoke during the cast bar.

**Flood of Obscurity**\
Knocks all players back from the Cloud of Darkness. All players then drop a briar patch – Evil Seed –  under them and take moderate magical damage.

**Rejuvenating Balm**\
The Cloud of Darkness will tether to two trees with a purple tether at opposite cardinal sides of the arena. These will emit a large circle AoE.
At the same time, all players will be tethered to their briar patch, as well as DPS with a random tank or healer. They must run far away from both to break the tether.

**Wide-angle Unlimited Phaser**\
The Cloud of Darkness will tether to a tree with two yellow tethers. At the end of the castbar, she will jump to the edge of the arena at the tree and perform three mechanics in succession.

* She will first emit a large conal AoE towards the arena. Players must stand directly beside her.
* Next she will target two tanks and two healers with a conal AoE that inflicts magic vulnerability. Players must spread tanks and healers while stacking DPS with healers.
* She will then cast a circle AoE around her. Players must get out of the hitbox.

**Anti-air Unlimited Phaser**\
The Cloud of Darkness will tether to a tree with two yellow tethers. At the end of the castbar, she will jump to the edge of the arena at the tree and perform three mechanics in succession.

* She will first cast a circle AoE around her. Players must get out of the hitbox.
* Next she will target two tanks and two healers with a circle that inflicts magic vulnerability. Players must spread tanks and healers while stacking DPS with healers.
* She will then emit a conal AoE towards the arena. Players must stand beside her to dodge it.

**Flood of Emptiness**\
Removes panels from the floor, and inflicts players with Cloying Condensation and Curse of Darkness. Curse of Darkness is a 15 second debuff that shoots a conal AoE where the player is facing when it expires. Cloying Condensation prevents the player from jumping.

**Hypercharged Condensation**\
Summons clouds at cardinal positions that move towards the Cloud of Darkness. If it is allowed to reach her, it grants her a damage up buff. These cannot be stunned, but can be heavied.

**Full-perimeter Particle Beam**\
A donut AoE around the Cloud of Darkness.

**Summon**\
The Cloud of Darkness will summon clones around the arena that mimic her next Art of Darkness, which will always be one orb.

**The Second Art of Darkness**\
The Cloud of Darkness casts two Art of Darkness mechanics in a row.

**The Third Art of Darkness**\
The Cloud of Darkness casts three Art of Darkness mechanics in a row. The first and third will always be one orb.

**Particle Concentration**\
The Cloud of Darkness will summon meteors that must be soaked. These spawn intercardinally on the inside and outside of the arena.

## Fight Strategy

#### Phase 1

* Pre-shield and mitigate the first Ground-razing Particle Beam.
  Giant orb indicates the Art of Darkness will be conal AoEs and should go to clock spots/proteans; two orbs indicates you will be stacking with your designated partner.
* Tank swap during the castbar of Devouring Dark. The tank taunting should use heavy mitigation.
* Mitigate and heal up Obscure Woods.
* Flood of Obscurity will drop a briar patch on each player a bit after the knockback. Have tanks and healers go north, and DPS go south. Players should spread out so they are not knocked back in a cardinal direction.
* Use anti-knockback on Flood of Obscurity, and drop your Evil Seed briar patches on the markers.
* Move out of the briar patch and note which trees she tethers to. The cardinals that she does not tether to will be safe after the next mechanic.
* Players should orient themselves so they are opposite of the other role on the safe side. For example, if the safe spots were north and south, Tanks and Healers would be north and DPS would be south.
* All players should simply run towards the opposite side to break both tethers and go to the safe spot for Rejuvenating Balm.
* Look at which mechanic is about to occur. For either mechanic, you will be moving towards the boss. However:

  * For Anti-air, you will be moving to outside of the boss’s hitbox near the edge of the arena where she jumps to.
  * For Wide-angle, you will be moving to beside the boss, close to the edge of the arena.
  * Each side of the boss should have one tank, one healer, and two DPS.
* Tanks will then move away from the party. The healer and two DPS designated to be on that side will stack together.

  * For Anti-Air, the tanks will move to the corners of the arena and mitigate. The party will move in slightly after the AoE.
  * For Wide-Angle, the party will already be stacked. The tanks needs to move to the front sides of the boss and mitigate.
* Immediately, she will cast the opposite mechanic.

  * For Wide-angle, you will be moving away from the boss along the edge of the arena.
  * For Anti-air, you will be moving to the edge of the arena close to the boss.
* Drag the boss back to the centre, heal, and mitigate for another raidwide AoE.
* The boss will then do The Second Art of Darkness. Go to the safe side of the arena first, then move to your designated partner or clock spot depending on whether there is a giant orb or two orbs.
* Next, do the opposite Phaser Unlimited mechanic you performed earlier.
* Tanks will swap again for Devouring Dark.
* Heal and mitigate for Empty Plane!

#### Phase 2

* Empty Plane is the hardest phase of the fight. Keep in mind you cannot stay on the same platform for more than ~15 seconds, and two players cannot be on the same platform at once.
* Spread to clock positions. Ranged should be at the cardinal edge and melee should be at the intercardinal edge.
* Melee will have to move one cardinal spot clockwise to kill the add. After killing the add, head back to the intercardinal platform and look away for Curse of Darkness.
* Once the melee move back, ranged should aim to move to the inner cardinal platform to “refresh” their timer as well as dodge Full-perimeter Particle Beam.
* All players should aim to “refresh” once more before the boss starts casting the Art of Darkness.
* This Art of Darkness will either cleave the left or right side of the room. Players must carefully move to the eight safe panels while not overlapping panels. In order to do so, the inner players must scoot in first to accomodate the outer players.

  * First, have the northwestern or northeastern melee move to the west or east inner panel.
  * The southwestern or southeastern player can move to the inner south panel without repercussion.
  * The melee on the other side should then move to where the northwestern or northeastern melee was.
  * Finally, the ranged on the far side should move to the north inner panel.
  * Remember to stand on the correct side of the panel if you are in a middle panel that has half of its area cleaved.
* Immediately move back afterwards to refresh the panel duration. All players should move back to their original spots.
* Prepare for protean or partner stack by healing and mitigating. The ranged should move into the inner panels.
* Perform one more refresh before mitigating and healing for Deluge of Darkness.
* Find the safe spot for Summon. The Cloud of Darkness will curve slightly, meaning the safe spot is slightly off cardinal.
* Mitigate and tank swap for Devouring Dark.
* Players should then perform the Third Art of Darkness. Players must move to one side, do either clock positions or stacks, then move to the other side.
* Heal up for Phase 3.

#### Phase 3

* Get ready for Flood of Obscurity. You’ll want to use your knockback prevention skill in order to drop your brambles in the right places.
* Players will not soak the meteor where they get knocked back to. Instead, they must break their tether with their partner first, then run opposite of their briar patch to break that tether. This will be done by making Tanks and Healers go north and DPS go south. This will put them at the opposite side of the arena, allowing them and their designated role partner to soak the two meteors they had assigned spots for.
* Do Anti-air or Wide-angle. Bring the boss back to the middle afterwards.
* The boss will cast Rejuvenating Balm and the Second Art of Darkness at the same time. You must dodge towards the safe side while being at the safe cardinal for Rejuvenating Balm, then immediately move to designated partners or clock spots depending on the mechanic.
* You have already seen all of the mechanics in the fight. The final phase is a repeat of the Empty Plane phase, with repeats of the panel mechanics, which increases the difficulty of the ending minutes of the fight. Make sure you practice these mechanics thoroughly if you cannot kill it before then.

#### PF Strategies

For Flood of Obscurity and Evil Seed, pugs generally either use Happy or Mith-Shara brambles. You will be safe with learning either.

For Empty Plane, groups typically use the refreshing strat outlined in this guide.

## Role Specific Tips

**Tank**

* Tanks should make sure to mitigate the copious amounts of raidwide damage from Empty Plane, Obscure Wood, and Ground-razing Particle Beam.
* Mitigate Devouring Dark beforehand. Stand apart from each other as well, as the beam comes immediately after the first hit.
* Move the boss to the middle to make it easier for certain jumping mechanics during the wood phase.
* Mitigate both the Anti-Air and Wide-Angle busters heavily.

**Healer**

* There is lots of heavy outgoing raidwide damage, and often you are forced to one side of the room, unable to heal half the raid. Make sure to coordinate extra heals if necessary.
* Make sure you get to the edge for Anti-air or Wide-angle quickly, as DPS will stack on you to soak.
* Keep the tank topped during panels phase, as they will be taking autos.
* Heavily mitigate Obscure Woods and Deluge of Darkness.

**DPS**

* Do not greed for positionals during panels phase.
* Use Addle on raidwides.
* Make sure to place your Evil Seed briar patch properly as to not obstruct any safe spots or Particle Concentration meteors.
